              <p>
                I initially came up with an idea involving a raspberry pi because I already had one available but I still needed to come
                up with something that I could use it for. I thought hard about it and decided to create a device that takes
                care of a plant so that the owner does not cause any harm to the plant. The way that it was going to work
                was that the plant would be automatically watered and given light from in a controlled environment. Although
                I did not have any experience with anything involving automation and raspberry pis, I decided I would give
                it a go so that I can explore more in the topics involving IoTs and the possibilties that a raspberry pi
                had to offer.
              </p>

                  <b>What are some questions I want to answer by doing this project?</b>
                </i>
              </h5>
              <p>
                In terms of research, I had several questions in the how sustainable the results of this project would become. I had questions
                whether it would be easier to care of crops and plants if the environment they were in was controlled environment
                rather than being outside. By conducting this experiment, will the amount of resources be reduced as result
                of being in a controlled environment? And if so, can this method be applied to an agricultural method for
                crops and other types of plants. Through successful experimentation, there is potentially reduce the amount
                of water and electricity used for farms as well as protecting against pests therefore redcuing chemical pesticides.
                However, if this fails, what other ways can we implement farming methods for different types of crops or
                plants? For this experiment, being in a controlled environment means that it will be indoors and away from
                external interferance.
                <br>
                <br> A more simpler problem to solve at this current moment would be taking care of home plants rather than crops.
                From personal experience, I tend to always find a way to kill a plant which is a problem when I want to furnish
                my living quarters with stylish flowers or exotic greenery. The problem here is that owners may forget to
                water a plant or unintentionally overwater a plant which can be unhealthy for the plant. Another situation
                would be if the owner decided to go on a vacation, the plant would be left alone and not be taken care of.
                From this experiment I hope to find a way to keep plants alive, hence, the name of the project -
                <b>Project Giving Resources for Organic Wellness (G.R.O.W.)</b>. If this experiment succeeds, the average plant
                owner can keep maintaining their plants without accidentally or unknowingly damaging their plant.
              </p>

                  <b>What am I proposing as a project and what I am going to do so solve the stated problems?</b>
                </i>
              </h5>
              <p>
                To solve the problems stated previously, I intend to make a contraption that performs all the hard work for me - provide
                water and light to the plant. However, before that happens, I actually still need to learn and develop the
                system that the this project will run on. This is a crucial step to the system in that the device or devices
                need to be implemented before making everything automated. I will need to buy the components required for
                developing everything that makes the device operational and then start experimenting with different ways
                I can accomplish my goal. Since it is my first time in the community of the maker movement, the first step
                would be to learn more about the raspberry pi and the capabilities that is has to offer. (See implementation
                below)
                <br>
                <br> When I have accomplished learning more about the raspberry pi, I would like to conduct a hand-on experiment
                involving automation and IoT. I want to be able to use the raspberry pi for watering and lighting purposes
                so that I do not have to do it myself. The experiment will be automated for the remainder of the system until
                the plant has fully grown where then I will analyze the result of the experiment. (See Research Design) Using
                the scientific method, I want to analyze and gather data to materialize ways in which I can ultimately apply
                my experiment to a larger scale.
              </p>

                <i>
                  <b>What do I expect to learn from this project?</b>
                </i>
              </h5>
              <p>
                In terms of technical knowledge, I expect to learn what a raspberry pi is capable of and how I can use IoT to help me in
                this project. My main concern is how well I can execute the ideas that I have in mind as I do not have much
                experience in any of the technical things I am going to be working with. I find it exciting to learn more
                about the technical aspects of this project and how I will proceed with hands-on experimentation in the several
                weeks to come. I am quite interested in the maker movement and I am expecting to learn a lot from the raspberry
                pi as it gives me the oppurtunity to perform a DIY experiment.
                <br>
                <br> Other things I expect to learn is how feasible it would be to autnomously take care of a plant over time.
                Some might say that it may be more work developing the system required in making this project rather that
                just watering the plant manually but, by doing this project I can find if that assumption is true or not.
                Autonomy can provide helpful tools in day-to-day tasks, hence, the reason why I chose the simple task of
                watering a plant. (So that I do not forget or accidentally overwater a plant, for example) The last thing I expect to learn
                would be web development because I want to make this website look nice and function smoothly.

              <br>
              <br> To be more specific, that platform would be none other than this website! Developing a website will allow me to dynamically

              <b>Set Up (Part 1)</b>
              <p>
                My set up involved placing everything at an isolated location which was a nearby desk. I initially used a tutorial to colearnnect
                how the raspberry pi connects to components as I did not entirely know what I was doing.
                <br>
                <br> Credit to the original set-up I followed can be found at the following link:
                <a href="http://www.cyber-omelette.com/2017/09/automated-plant-watering.html">Original Set-Up</a>
                <br>
                <br> With the help of my two friends,
                <b>Rudy Sandoval</b> and
                <b>Anthony Cuevas</b>, I was able to set up all the components with the raspberry pi.
                <br>
                <br> We started by making connections to certain parts of the raspberry pi with the jumper wires. I used the
                relay to connect the water pump to the moisture sensor and the raspberry pi. The sensitivity of the moisture
                sensor could be adjusted by an actuator on the water sensor. Whenever the water moisture sensor sent a negative
                signal, it meant that the soil needed watering and would tell the raspberry pi to activate the water pump.
                We soldered cables together to improve the length of the cables and also soldering a stripped USB power cable
                to connect to the relay.

                <b>Set Up (Part 2)</b>
                <br> Using a hot glue gun, we attached the pipe to the output hole of the water pump. I poked small holes in
                the pipe so that when the water traveled down the pipe it would spray or drip out. I wrapped the pipe around
                the pot and positioned it above the soil so that when the water flowed through, the water would fall towards
                the seeds.

                <b>Set Up (Part 3)</b>
                <br>I used a python script to automate the watering of the plant which was constantly running while the raspberry
                pi was on. I set up a 24/7 live stream with the raspberry pi camera so that anyone can view the plant's progress
                live. The stream can be viewed by visiting the
                <a href="watch.html">watch</a> tab in the navigation bar at the top of the website.

                <br> Next was the lighting system for the plant. I used the LED Smart Lightbulb fixated to a desk lamp to illuminate
                the experimental group when indoors. By using an LED light bulb I was able to use less electricity than another
                bulb. On top of being energy efficient, I was also able to connect the light bulb to Alexa and schedule the
                lights to turn on and off during certain times of the day (IoT).
                <br>
                <br> That pretty much sums up the set-up I had for this project.

            <p class="card-text">
              After all the components were connected to the raspberry pi, I started to develop and customize a python script in the raspberry
              pi to automate the watering of the plant.
              <br>
              <br> Soon afterwards, I planted the seeds in both the experimental and control group so they would start growing
              soon. I will be keeping the experimental group indoors while the control group will be outside.
              <br>
              <br> After the seeds were planted I placed the airline tube to water the experimental group in such a way that
              it sprayed water above the soil.
              <br>
              <br> After calibrating the water sensor to a suitable water moisture setting, I turned on the automatic watering
              in the raspberry pi and let it get to work.
              <br>
              <br> From then on, I pretty much left the system running for more than a month while updating the
              <a href="plant_progress.html">plant progress</a>
              section with updates on the plant's growth.

              The graph above shows quantitative data for the growth rate for the experimental and control group. As you can see, the experimental
              group grew significantly faster than the control group.
              <br>
              <br> Both plants then started to grow at a reasonable pase but the experimental group was always taller in height
              than the control group. Soon after the 20th day, some of plants starting wilting and some even withered away.

            <p>
              As soon as I started Day 1, I was excited to see the outcome of the experiment. I did still need to water the control group
              every other day while the experimental group was being watered automatically based on the moisture of the soil.
              <br>
              <br> It was a rather quick experience as one month goes by fast. Every day, I would wake up to see the proress
              of the plants and was fascinated by how much they've grown.
              <br>
              <br>To be honest, I would say the hardest part of this project would have to be choosing a plant to do the experiment
              with as there were many to choose from. I was debating between a crop or a floral plant and ended up choosing
              a floral plant because crops take way longer to grow than flowers.
              <br>
              <br> I hope to try this experiment again with different methods and constraints so that I may see a different outcome
              in the future.

            <p>
              In response to the research questions, I believe the following information describes the outcome of the experiment
              <br>
              <ul class="my-4">
                <li>The experimental group grew faster than I expected which is a good sign</li>
                <li>Using my device, I was able to take care of my plant autonomously with minimal damage</li>
                <li>The amount of water used was approximately 1 gallon (1 quart plastic refilled 4 times), thus, using less
                  water than manual watering</li>
                <li>Using an LED light does not take that much power, thus, reducing the amount of energy usage</li>
                <li>This has the potential to become part of a larger scale, but would need significant changes to the components
                  and method of irrigation</li>
              </ul>
              There is potential for agricultural farms but mainly towards indoor warehouse farming. Through my experiment, I have
              proved that there is potential to grow plants in a controlled environment. This can be applied to growing crops
              in a giant warehouse involving...

              I believe that this research experiment was a success even with minor downsides. This experiment exhibited the potential
              of autonomously taking care of plants. The growth rate of the experimental group was significantly greater
              than the control group.

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              The main thing that surprised me was that I had to occasionally change the water moisture sensor as it kept getting corroded
              after being wet several times. This, I believe, ended up corroding the soil resulting in some of the plants
              to wither and die.
              <br>
              <br> I was initially really surprised about the growth rate of the experimental group as it was significantly faster
              than the control group. I was also surprised that the control group took very long to start sprouting although
              I started both plants on the same day.
              <br>
              <br> Another unexpected outcome was the the python script didn't work as well as I thought it would and would sometimes
              overwater the plants. During these cases, I would restart the script and everything would go back to normal.

              There were minor drawbacks when I was conducting this experiment which I will definitely take into account the next time
              I perform this experiment. Next time I will use a water proof water moisture sensor to prevent corrosion. I
              will also test the irrigation system before I start planting to make sure that the position in which the water
              hits the soil and seeds is optimal.

              The project was a success even though the plant is still growing. The data involving the autonomous system against the control

              I will continue to update the website until after the flowers start to bloom and then I am thinking about experimenting
              with a revised version of this system using a different plant.
